Concurrency and Testing Codes

### Problem 1 - Reader Writer Problem

Given the size of a `circular buffer` and number of `readers`, write a code with `n+1` `threads`, n for readers and 1 for the `writers`. All are accessing the same circular buffer. The following conditions should be satisfied:

- A reader cannot read in an empty location.
- A reader will not read from the same location twice if the writer has not overwritten.
- A writer cannot overwrite a place which has not been read by every reader.

***Input*** : Size of buffer, n

You can use random function for writing data into the buffer.

### Problem 2 - War of Roses

The conflict between the `Yorks` and `Lanncasters` in Britain is famously remembered as the War of Roses. Though both are descendants from the same bloodlines, they were invloved in a massive struggle for power which lead to many wars. 

`Inn` keepers have a real tough time during the wars, especially those whose inn lies in the battle zone. But they are also the only source of good ale, and thus both the armies don't want to burn em down. Hence, both the parties came to a treaty. 

The treaty was that at a given time `no two soldiers` of `different armies` can be present `inside the inn` at the same time. Also, since the size of the inn is not infinite, after the `inn is full`, others shall `wait outside in line`, without making any conflict. They are encouraged to share songs amongst themselves, and have a laugh while they wait.

Each soldier is a `thread`, and is `randomly` to be assigned as a York or a Lanncaster. Simluate the above given scenario, without causing any conflicts to the treaty. Make sure that no soldier has to wait unnecesarily outside.

***Input*** : The `capacity` of the inn.

### Problem 3 - Concurrent Merge Sort in Shared Memory

Given a number `n` and n numbers, sort the numbers using Merge Sort.

Recursively make two child processes, one for the left half, one of the right half. If the number of elements in the array for a process is `less than 5`, perform a `selection sort`. 

The parent of the two children then merges the result and returns back to the parent and so on.

Compare the performace of the merge sort with a normal merge sort implementation.

### Problem 4 - `perf` testing

Make use of `$perf stat -p <pid> sleep <seconds>`

##### a) DC client perf testing

Run `dtella` on your machines and connect to the hub on DC client of your choice (like `linuxdcpp`) for 3-4 hours. Run the perf test on the DC client every 10/20 seconds and make a plot of :

1. `CPU-usage vs Time`
2. `Context Switch per second vs Time`

An exhaustive testing will imply running the DC client with various other programs which are `I/O intensive` or `CPU intensive` or both and see how the graphs vary, etc.

##### b) Merge Sort of Big File (>1GB) using bash command sort.

Generate a file > 1GB in size containing integers and run the `sort` command on bash to sort it while running `perf` on it.

Write a script which splits the file into two parts recursively and then runs the sort command once the `size of the split` is at `below some threshold`, say `10MB`, `100MB` or `200MB` and so on, and then performs a `merge` operation. Run perf on the script you write for each of the thresholds chosen and compare how the results of perf vary with increase in the threshold size, or number of splits.

### NOTE 
Each problem has its own `readme.md` and `analysis` (wherever required).
